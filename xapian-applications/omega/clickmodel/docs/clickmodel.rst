Introduction
============

Clicks in web search reflect user interests in retrieved documents and by the
use of various methods, clicks can be used to improve search results. Click
models are one such methods. These are probabilistic graphical models that
make user clicks easier to understand, define and quantify.

There are various kinds of click models among which the dynamic bayesian
network (DBN) model is proved to be able to closely mimic the userâ€™s search
behavior. The underlying idea of DBN model is that if a user is satisfied
with a document in the search engine results page (SERP), he/she stops
otherwise, continues to examine more documents with fixed probability.

The Simplified DBN model (SDBN), according to the paper_: `Chapelle, Olivier and
Zhang, Ya. A dynamic bayesian network click model for web search ranking.
Proceedings of WWW, pages 1-10, 2009.`__
is a simplified variation of DBN model wherein the inference algorithm is
relatively simpler. It contains the set of attractiveness and satisfactoriness
parameters, which both depend on a query and a document.

Training the SDBN model
=======================

For training the model, we need the list of search sessions obtained from
clickstream log data. Xapian Omega has the clickstream logging functionality
which generates click log data in the required format in ``final.log`` file.

A few example entries in ``final.log``:

	QueryID,Query,Hits,Offset,Clicks
	821f03288846297c2cf43c34766a38f7,book,"45,54",0,"45:0,54:2"
	098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6,test,"35,47",0,"35:1,47:0"

``SimplifiedDBN`` class provides train function that takes a search session
as its input:

	``void SimplifiedDBN::train(vector<vector<string>> &sessions)``

To generate search sessions from the log data file, ``SimplifiedDBN`` class
also provides a separate function which takes the path to the log data file
as its input:

	``vector<vector<string>> SimplifiedDBN::buildSessions(string logfile)``

Predicting the Document Relevance
=================================

``SimplifiedDBN`` class provides a function to get the predicted relevance of
all documents in a search session based on the trained SDBN model:

	vector<int> get_predicted_relevances(vector<vector<string>> &sessions);

It takes a search session as its input and returns a list of predicted relevances
of each document in that search session.
